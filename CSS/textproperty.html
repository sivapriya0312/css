        <h1>Koala</h1>
        <h2>Habitat</h2>
        <p><b>Koala populations only occur if suitable habitat is available. The two most important factors which make habitats suitable are the presence of tree species preferred by Koalas (usually eucalypts, but also some non-eucalypts) growing in particular associations on suitable soils with adequate rainfall and the presence of other Koalas.</b></p>
